# MyPr0j3cts
an archive of some personal projects I worked on, basically interesting projects I wanted to try out,   or anything that beat records on runtime and space complexity. There are also a few Java projects that I had when I began programming. 

If you want more details and descriptions, each file has its own read me, and if the project is more detailed, it should have its own txt.
or at least a javadoc description.
