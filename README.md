# MyPr0j3cts
an archive of some personal projects I worked on, basically interesting projects I wanted to try out,   or anything that beat records on runtime and space complexity. There are also a few Java projects that I had when I began programming. 

If you want more details and descriptions, most files have some form of javadoc/documentation, and if the project is more detailed, it should have its own txt/readme.
