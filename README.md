# MyPr0j3cts
an archive of some personal projects I worked on, basically material that took me hours to finish, interesting projects I wanted to try out,   or anything that beat records. There are also a few Java projects that I worked on during my beginner journey. 

If you want more details and descriptions, each file has its own read me, and if the project is more detailed, it should have its own txt.
or at least a javadoc description.
